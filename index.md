  The Cyber-Physical Systems Laboratory (CPSLab) conducts research at the intersection of distributed computation, energy, security and privacy, and control of Cyber-Physical Systems. We investigate the performance modeling, data analysis, system security and privacy, and control of Cyber-Physical Systems. We are part of the FIU SCIS and are physically located at PG6 143 of FIU MMC campus.
